The symbol table is implemented using hash table as data structure.
It has two fields: the size and an array of Strings.
Every key is added in the hash table based on the hash value obtained from the hash function.
For the hash function, I have used the sum of ascii characters % size (the basic hash function from the course)

Key:                            Value:                          
0                               "a is not prime"                
1                               d                               
2                               2                               
3                               "a is prime"                    
7                               a                               
8                               0                               
9                               1
