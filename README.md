# FLCD_Project

This project was developed during the Formal Languages and Compiler Design Course, Babes-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca, year 3, semester 1

Considering a small programming language (that we shall call mini-language), you have to write a scanner (lexical analyser)

Lexic.txt (file containing mini language lexic description)

token.in (containing the list of all tokens corresponding to the minilanguage)

Syntax.in - the syntactical rules of the language

Symbol table is implemented as a hash table and is unique for identifiers and constants
